      "Can't recommend Aulona enough, yoga nidra has healed me in ways I hadn't found possible. It's been such a rewarding experience going to class and it's the highlight of my week. Her energy is unmatched and she puts her all into the practice. Such a kind and beautiful soul, not only have I secured an amazing guide for yoga but I've made such a special friend",

      "The class has been such a welcoming space for me on the times I've been. I've always felt comfortable and accepted there which has been so nice as I'd never attended anything like it before. The classes themselves have been incredible for me as they've given me a huge step towards letting go of stress and anger and things that are outside of my control. Even when I've been unable to attend I've been able to take away the lessons I've learned and used them to help ground myself. Really cannot recommend the classes and Aulona herself as she's an incredible teacher and somebody I highly respect.",

      "I was very fortunate to attend two of Aulonas yoga sessions recently at a wellness retreat in Portugal and absolutely loved the uniqueness and calmness of both sessions. Aulona has an amazing calming and nurturing energy and provides support throughout each session in assisted means to suit each individualperson.I came away from each session feeling both calm and like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders.I can't wait to attend Aulonas sessions at home very soon and would highly recommend for anyone looking for a yoga practice at any stage of their yoga journey. As a beginner myself I absolutely loved that it challenged me without feeling out of my depth.Beautiful sessions hosted by an amazingly beautiful soul.",

    review: "Practicing with Aulona during a wellness & yoga retreat in Portugal was such a beautiful experience. Her classes had the perfect balance of strength, softness & mindfulness. Her energy made everyone feel safe & supported. Aulona has a wonderful way of guiding you to connect more deeply with your body & breath I still think of her words when I step on the mat. I left feeling grounded, open & completely at peace. She’s truly a gifted teacher, & I’m so grateful to have practiced with her.",
